## Beginning of Journey

Harshil started his journey at the age of 14 when I was eagerly interested to dig deeper into the field of robotics science. His hunger to innovate and invent started when he was just 14. He started his own tech blog known as 'Tecotize' which taught him 'How to build a team?'. By the time he was 15, his interests got shifted towards robotics .By 16, he was so call in love with building those flying machines(drones) and this is what helped him in starting his freelancing journey. Getting into UAVs costs a huge pile of money but **dreams just can't wait**, so he started freelancing into website development, animations, and graphic designs to fund his own projects.
## Vicube and Smart Tee
Started 'Vicube' in class 11th with one of his cofounders which aimed at providing web and chatbot services to our clients but he always wanted to shift to a product based business. 

They were working on 'SmarTee' in 2019, a cloud enabled health monitoring tshirt which monitored various health parameters and primarily ECG and all cloud enabled so you can track your old aged parents health from any part of the globe. They were working day & night to monitor the ecg data while the human body is doing any movements. They failed at this part but they successfully traced the ecg graph for an Idle body. They wanted to predict heart attacks 30 mins prior to its occurrence. From manufacturing our own synthetic electrodes to putting this project on halt, this has been a rollercoaster ride.
## Starting of  **[SidePath]( https://thesidepath.in/) ** an alternative education platform for students
He is currently working on an alternative education platform for students, with courses and industries that they are never made familiar in school/college life. They will be helping out the youths to discover what they are passionate about and take the first step i.e getting from 0 to 1. Their vision to build SidePath is mainly driven by the line '80% of the engineers remain unemployed in India'.
